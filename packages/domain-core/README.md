# domain-core

## Purpose

Primary domain logic package (starting monolith; split later by bounded context).

## Rules

- Keep repo structure coherent and low-entropy.
- Prefer platform commands over manual restructuring.
- Prefer pure packages; keep environment-specific wiring in apps/.
- Avoid accidental coupling: shared code belongs here, not duplicated across apps.
- Depend only on packages/shared-types and packages/domain-events.
- Keep domain logic pure; keep infrastructure plumbing in packages/firebase.

## Notes

Generated by `syntropy gen readmes`.
