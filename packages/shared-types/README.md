# shared-types

## Purpose

Cross-domain primitive types shared across the codebase.

## Rules

- Keep repo structure coherent and low-entropy.
- Prefer platform commands over manual restructuring.
- Prefer pure packages; keep environment-specific wiring in apps/.
- Avoid accidental coupling: shared code belongs here, not duplicated across apps.
- Do not depend on other @syntropy/* packages.
- Keep primitives stable; avoid domain-specific semantics here.

## Notes

Generated by `syntropy gen readmes`.
