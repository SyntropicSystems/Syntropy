# firebase

## Purpose

Firebase client helpers and infrastructure plumbing.

## Rules

- Keep repo structure coherent and low-entropy.
- Prefer platform commands over manual restructuring.
- Prefer pure packages; keep environment-specific wiring in apps/.
- Avoid accidental coupling: shared code belongs here, not duplicated across apps.
- No domain business logic; keep domain rules in packages/domain-core.
- Keep the public surface small and stable; prefer helpers over abstractions.

## Notes
