# design-tokens

## Purpose

Design tokens (colors, spacing, typography) shared across surfaces.

## Rules

- Keep repo structure coherent and low-entropy.
- Prefer platform commands over manual restructuring.
- Prefer pure packages; keep environment-specific wiring in apps/.
- Avoid accidental coupling: shared code belongs here, not duplicated across apps.
- No runtime dependencies; export constants only.
- Keep tokens platform-agnostic and stable.
