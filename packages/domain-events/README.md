# domain-events

## Purpose

Event sourcing primitives and event type definitions.

## Rules

- Keep repo structure coherent and low-entropy.
- Prefer platform commands over manual restructuring.
- Prefer pure packages; keep environment-specific wiring in apps/.
- Avoid accidental coupling: shared code belongs here, not duplicated across apps.
- Depend only on packages/shared-types.
- Keep pure (no Firebase/network side effects).
