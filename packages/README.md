# packages

## Purpose

TypeScript packages (domain logic, infrastructure, and UI primitives).

## Rules

- Keep repo structure coherent and low-entropy.
- Prefer platform commands over manual restructuring.
- Prefer pure packages; keep environment-specific wiring in apps/.
- Avoid accidental coupling: shared code belongs here, not duplicated across apps.
