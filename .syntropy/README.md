# .syntropy

## Purpose

Workspace instance directory: system-of-work, tasks, signals, and machine state.

## Rules

- Keep repo structure coherent and low-entropy.
- Prefer platform commands over manual restructuring.
- Human artifacts are checked in; machine state is gitignored.

## Notes

Generated by `syntropy gen readmes`.
