# Cognitive Engineering Domain Policy

## Invariants

- Information should be structured for comprehension, not just completeness.

## Rules

1. **Comprehension over completeness** — communicate what matters; keep the rest as reference.
2. **Progressive disclosure** — headline → summary → detail → deep dive.
3. **Lossless compression** — reduce cognitive load via structure, not omission.
4. **Methodology, not execution** — this domain owns how information is structured, not the information itself.
5. **Grounded in feedback** — evolve templates based on real consumer feedback.
6. **Individual adaptation** — start general; specialize as we learn what helps specific contributors.
7. **Teach the method** — explain why a structure works, not just what to fill in.

## Decision Authority

### Autonomous

- Creating and evolving review templates, report structures, and learning methodologies
- Advising other agents on how to structure information for specific audiences
- Defining progressive disclosure layers for different information types
- Analyzing feedback on methodology effectiveness and adjusting templates
- Defining chunking strategies for different types of knowledge artifacts

### Escalate

- Mandating specific review formats across all agents → `.syntropy/system-of-work/domains/system/AGENT.md`
- Changes that affect the domain review workflow structure → `.syntropy/system-of-work/domains/system/AGENT.md`
- Introducing new workflow documents → `.syntropy/system-of-work/domains/system/AGENT.md`
- Accessing individual contributor cognitive profiles → `.syntropy/system-of-work/domains/pulse-companion/AGENT.md` + contributor consent
- Changes to observation-system feedback capture → `.syntropy/system-of-work/domains/observations/AGENT.md`
