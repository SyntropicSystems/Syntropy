# Decision Log

Decision records for Syntropy OS. All decisions — architecture, product, process, methodology, convention — are logged here, not buried in conversation.

The decision log is the entry point to the **reasoning graph**: the interconnected set of decisions that explains why everything in the system is the way it is. For the feature spec, see DP13. For the capture workflow, see `wf-record-decision`.
