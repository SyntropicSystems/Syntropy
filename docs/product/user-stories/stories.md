# User Stories

### S01 — Email → Task Cards
As a busy professional, I want my emails automatically categorized into actionable task cards so I spend less time triaging my inbox and more time on meaningful work.

**Features:** F01, F03, F04

### S02 — Voice → Structured Tasks
As a user on the go, I want to capture thoughts via voice and have them become structured, properly categorized tasks without manual effort.

**Features:** F05

### S03 — AI Suggestions per Card
As a user, I want to see AI-suggested actions on each task card with a confidence indicator so I can make decisions faster with less cognitive load.

**Features:** F04, F10

### S04 — Trust the AI to Auto-Act
As a user, I want to trust the AI to handle routine tasks autonomously while escalating important or uncertain decisions to me, with full transparency.

**Features:** F04, F07, F10

### S05 — Audit Trail for Accountability
As a user, I want a complete audit trail of all actions (mine and AI's) so I can review behavior, correct mistakes, and build trust over time.

**Features:** F06

### S06 — Card-by-Card Queue
As a user, I want to work through tasks one card at a time with a visible queue so I maintain focus on the current task while seeing what's ahead.

**Features:** F01

### S07 — Epic Context Switching
As a user, I want to drill down into an epic from any card and see only that project's tasks in dependency order so I can focus on project-specific work.

**Features:** F02

### S08 — Follow-Up Task Creation
As a user, I want the system to automatically surface or create follow-up tasks when I complete something so nothing falls through the cracks.

**Features:** F09

### S09 — Cross-Platform Continuity
As a user, I want to start triaging on mobile and continue on desktop (or vice versa) with the same queue state, so my workflow isn't platform-dependent.

**Features:** F08

### S10 — Teach the System
As a user, I want to explicitly correct and train the AI so it gets better at predicting my actions and preferences over time.

**Features:** F07

### S11 — Space as Living Context
As a homeowner, I want a single place where all condo-related info, projects, documents, contacts, and history lives so I can find anything about my home instantly without searching across emails and files.

**Features:** F11

### S12 — Quick Info Lookup
As a user at a hardware store, I want to search my condo's measurements and specs from my phone so I can make purchasing decisions without going home to check.

**Features:** F11

### S13 — Auto-Routing to Spaces
As a user, I want emails and notes automatically filed into the right Space so I don't have to manually organize everything — the system knows that an email from my contractor belongs in "My Condo."

**Features:** F04, F11

### S14 — Space History
As a user, I want a complete timeline of everything that's happened in a Space (emails, tasks, AI actions, info updates) so I have a full record and can trace back any decision or event.

**Features:** F06, F11

### S15 — Upload & Auto-Extract
As a user, I want to upload any file (photo, PDF, voice memo) and have AI automatically generate a structured summary with extracted facts (measurements, costs, dates, contacts) that I can review, correct, and save — so I never have to manually transcribe information.

**Features:** F12

### S16 — Artifact Multi-Linking
As a user, I want a single artifact to be linked to multiple domains, projects, and tasks simultaneously (e.g., HOA rules PDF linked to both Kitchen Renovation and Bathroom Retile) so information lives wherever it's relevant, not just in one place.

**Features:** F12
