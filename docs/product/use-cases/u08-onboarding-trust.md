# U08 — Onboarding & Trust Building

## Scenario
New user connects Gmail. System starts in "training mode" — AI suggests but never auto-acts. Over the first week, user accepts/rejects suggestions. By week 2, the AI's suggestions are 85% aligned. User enables auto-archive for newsletters. By month 2, user enables auto-reply for routine patterns. Trust ratchets up organically.

## Features Exercised
- F10 — Confidence Thresholds & Trust Controls
- F07 — Self-Learning System
- F04 — AI Action Engine
