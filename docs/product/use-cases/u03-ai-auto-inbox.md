# U03 — AI Auto-Managing Inbox

## Scenario
Over time, the AI learns: this sender is always archived, these emails always become tasks, this type of newsletter is read on Sundays. It begins auto-executing: archiving, categorizing, drafting replies for routine patterns. The user's morning triage goes from 50 cards to 8 — only the ones that genuinely need human judgment.

## Features Exercised
- F04 — AI Action Engine
- F07 — Self-Learning System
- F03 — Gmail / Google Workspace Integration
- F10 — Confidence Thresholds & Trust Controls
