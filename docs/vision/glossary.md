# Glossary

Canonical term definitions for Syntropy OS. This is the shared language — use these terms consistently across all documents.

| Term | Definition |
|------|-----------|
| **Card** | The atomic unit of the system. Any actionable item presented as a card in the queue. |
| **Queue** | The ordered list of cards the user works through. Can be filtered by domain or project. |
| **Domain / Space** | A permanent, persistent container for an entire life area (My Condo, Career, Finances). Contains projects, tasks, reference info, artifacts, and a full event history. |
| **Project** | A time-bound effort within a Domain. Has tasks, a budget, a deadline, and completes when all tasks are done. Replaces "Epic" in earlier terminology. |
| **Dependency** | A relationship where Task B cannot be actioned until Task A is complete. |
| **Confidence** | AI's self-assessed probability that its suggested action is correct (0–100%). |
| **Threshold** | User-configurable confidence level above which AI auto-executes without asking. |
| **Event** | An immutable record of any action taken in the system. Append-only in the event log (storage backend TBD). |
| **Audit Trail** | The browsable, filterable log of all events. |
| **Agent** | A specialized AI prompt + context strategy for a specific domain (Email Agent, Finance Agent, Home Agent). |
| **Quick Capture** | The multimodal input system (voice, text, photo) for rapid task creation. |
| **Materialized View** | A precomputed view (e.g., queue order, project stats) derived from the event log by projection workers/triggers (implementation TBD). |
| **Artifact** | Any uploaded or captured file (photo, PDF, voice memo, document) that has been processed by the AI extraction pipeline and linked to domains/projects/tasks. |
| **Surface** | A platform or interface through which users interact with the system (mobile app, web app, development platform). |
| **Decision Density Threshold** | The target ratio of "decisions made" to "decisions documented" — ensuring that choices and their reasoning are captured at a rate that keeps the reasoning graph comprehensive. When the ratio drops below threshold, the Coherence Engine's passive monitoring surfaces it for attention. Part of DJ18. |
| **Decision Record** | A structured capture of any decision — the problem it solves, the options explored, what was decided, how to know it's working, and when to revisit. Decision records form a reasoning graph: they have hierarchy (parent/child), domain scope, and relationships to other decisions. Generalizes the ADR (Architecture Decision Record) pattern to all decision types: product, process, methodology, convention, principle. Classified as Type 1 (hard to reverse) or Type 2 (easily reversible). |
| **DRI** | Directly Responsible Individual — the agent (human or AI) that owns a domain and is accountable for its correctness. |
| **Observation** | A raw signal captured by any contributor — a friction, bug, idea, question, anxiety, pattern, need, praise, or any thought worth recording. Observations are the atomic unit of emergent intelligence: they accumulate, get structured retroactively, and are audited for patterns that inform system evolution. |
| **Upleveling** | The principle that every interaction and feedback loop should help contributors become more effective over time — better at expressing ideas, capturing observations, structuring thoughts, and contributing to the system — without creating dependency or learned helplessness. |
| **Reflection** | A special type of observation captured after completing work — a genuine, personal account of what the contributor experienced: what worked, what was hard, how it felt, what they'd need next time. Not a system design exercise or retrospective about others, but honest self-noticing that feeds the observation system as signal. |
| **Pulse Companion** | A personalized work companion agent that grows alongside each contributor — starting as a reflection assistant (helping articulate experience through context-aware questions) and evolving by emergence into a full work ally that understands behavior patterns, supports effectiveness, and collaborates across contributors to surface collective signals for system evolution. |
| **Reasoning Graph** | The interconnected graph of decision records that explains why everything in the system is the way it is. Traversable by hierarchy (problem stack), domain, and relationships. The reasoning graph is what would allow rebuilding the system from scratch — not identical, but with the same informed choices. |
| **Semantic Drift** | The condition where documents are structurally valid but semantically inconsistent — they pass validation (refs exist, naming correct, frontmatter complete) but their *meaning* no longer aligns with current principles or philosophy. Example: a domain context still references "skill trees" after the system pivoted to "pattern journals." Structural coherence tools can't catch this; the Coherence Engine's semantic layer can. Addressed by DJ16. |
| **Session Protocol** | A structured workflow for session boundaries (start, pause, resume, end) that captures and recovers context so transitions are seamless. `wf-begin-session` surfaces what changed, shows active threads, recommends focus. `wf-end-session` captures state, runs coherence checks, flags unintegrated insights. The protocol that solves the Tuesday Morning Problem. Addressed by DJ17. |
| **Revisit Trigger** | A condition defined in a decision record that, when met, signals the decision should be reconsidered. Prevents decisions from becoming dogma by making expiration explicit and graceful. |
| **Actor** (dev platform) | Any entity that executes work processes — a human contributor, a specific AI model (Opus, Sonnet, Haiku, etc.), or a configured agent. Different actors have different capabilities, context handling, reasoning styles, and failure modes. Operational engineering designs processes that account for these differences. |
| **Operational Engineering** | The discipline of designing work processes (workflows, rules, skills, context configurations, agent manifests) so that different actors can execute them effectively. The operational-engineering-agent is the DRI — it owns the methodology for how processes should be designed, not the processes themselves. Parallel to cognitive engineering: CE owns how information is structured for comprehension (output side); OE owns how processes are structured for effective execution (input side). |
| **Cognitive Engineering** | The discipline of structuring information for actual human and agent comprehension. Encompasses review templates, learning briefs, knowledge compression methodologies, progressive disclosure patterns, and cognitive adaptation strategies. The cognitive-engineering-agent is the DRI for this domain — it owns the methodology for how information should be presented, not the information itself. The system evolves through individual and collective feedback loops and progressively personalizes delivery based on how different contributors absorb information. |
| **Progressive Disclosure** | An information architecture principle where content is layered (headline → summary → detail → deep dive) so that a reader can stop at any layer and have a coherent understanding appropriate to that depth. The core structural pattern used in all cognitive engineering templates. |
| **Workspace Contract** | The single configuration file (`syntropy.toml`) that defines a workspace's structure, services, conventions, and behavior. Schema-validated, versioned, and the only config file humans review. Unknown keys are errors. |
| **Workspace Instance** | The `.syntropy/` directory that contains both human-facing artifacts (tasks, system-of-work docs, signals) and machine-generated state (indexes, caches). Follows explicit checked-in vs ignored conventions. |
| **Workspace State** | The structured, machine-readable output of `syntropy state --json` — a hydration contract that provides agents and tools with a complete understanding of the workspace without parsing files or inferring meaning. |
| **PatchSet** | A transactional set of file changes produced by the plan/apply engine. Previewed before application, applied atomically, and reversible. The unit of workspace mutation. |
| **Plan/Apply** | The transactional pattern where structural changes to a workspace are first previewed as a patchset (plan), reviewed by the operator, and then executed atomically (apply). All platform mutations use this pattern. |
| **Blueprint** | A reusable template that defines the structure, files, and configuration for a new workspace component (service, app, crate). Platform-provided blueprints cover standard patterns; projects can define custom blueprints in `.syntropy/system-of-work/templates/`. |
| **Validation Report** | The deterministic, machine-readable output of `syntropy validate --json` — a contract that enumerates all structural violations, dependency issues, and convention drift in a workspace. Each violation has an error code, location, and fix hint. |
| **North Star Layout** | The canonical repository structure that the Syntropy platform targets. Everything in the repo is one of five categories: Platform (reusable foundation), Products (shipped surfaces), Tooling (build/CI/devex), Workspaces (fixtures/templates), and Instance (`.syntropy/`). |
| **Trait** | A composable set of context, rules, and workflows that an agent inherits. Agents are composed from base traits + domain-specific traits. |
| **Experience Layer** | The fourth layer of the platform stack (Platform -> System of Work -> Personality -> Experience) that makes every interaction between humans and AI intrinsically satisfying. Not gamification (badges on work) but experience architecture: genuine agency, mastery, discovery, expression, belonging, and purposeful progress. Built on game design principles from Borderlands (systemic personality) and MMORPGs (social depth, persistent world). Documented as a modular system of core loops, progression, companion, social, world map, narrative, and expression subsystems. |
| **Pattern Journal** | A personal, private record of a contributor's work, growth, and emerging patterns — the story of who they're becoming, told through the evidence of what they've done. Not a scorecard but a mirror. Entries are generated from work artifacts (commits, PRs, observations) and written in narrative form. Part of the Experience Layer's progression system. |
| **Emergent Archetype** | A contributor's working style pattern that emerges from observed behavior rather than self-selection. Multi-dimensional (primary, secondary, tertiary), non-hierarchical, and evolving. Examples: The Foundry ("builds the tools that build the things"), The Archaeologist ("digs until finding the real reason"), The Cartographer ("makes the territory legible for others"). Part of the Experience Layer's progression system. |
| **Calibration Loop** | A feedback mechanism for verifying that agent decisions align with system principles. Agent decisions are reviewed, corrections are provided, and those corrections trace back to principle refinements — creating a cycle where the system improves the system. Part of the Coherence Engine's Phase 4. |
| **Capture Gap** | The delay and fragility between "insight occurred" and "insight is integrated into the system." A breakthrough in conversation needs to ripple into vision docs, domain contexts, glossary entries, feature specs, and cross-references. The gap is the manual, error-prone translation step that's the first thing to slip under pressure. Addressed by DJ15. |
| **Coherence Engine** | The system-level mechanism that keeps Syntropy's knowledge graph semantically coherent as it grows. Three modes: passive monitoring (detecting drift), active integration (propagating changes), and session management (context recovery at boundaries). The system-level equivalent of what the companion does for an individual — maintaining the bird's eye view, catching drift, ensuring every change ripples correctly. See DP18 and `docs/vision/coherence-engine.md`. |
| **Coherence Score** | A composite diagnostic metric for a domain or the system as a whole, measuring structural integrity, semantic alignment, decision coverage, freshness, and integration completeness. Used to identify where attention is needed, not to judge quality. Part of the Coherence Engine. |
| **Collaboration Manual** | A "how to play co-op with me" profile derived from the Pattern Journal — strengths, learning edges, working style, and communication preferences. Opt-in, self-controlled, and curated by the contributor. The system suggests entries; the human decides what's shared. |
| **Learning Residue** | The thin layer of understanding that accumulates imperceptibly from every AI interaction — through contextual "why" explanations, pattern surfacing, and connecting new concepts to known ones. The mechanism by which the Experience Layer's apprenticeship system builds understanding rather than dependency. |
| **Fog of War** (experience layer) | A metaphor from game design applied to platform exploration: parts of the system you haven't touched are visible in outline but reveal detail only as you engage. Familiarity increases through code reading, PR review, bug fixing, and domain agent conversation; it decays slowly with absence. |
| **Loot** (experience layer) | Anything that persists and compounds from a work engagement — from common (task completed) through legendary (paradigm shift that improves the system for everyone). Recognized by the system based on what persisted, got reused, prevented future problems, or was referenced by others. Not assigned by humans. |
| **Guild** (experience layer) | A community of practice within the platform. Domain guilds gather everyone working in a domain; interest guilds cross-cut around shared interests (e.g., Rust, observability); quest guilds form temporarily for specific missions. Companions share context across guild members and surface collective patterns. |
| **Core Loop** | One of three nested feedback loops in the Experience Layer: the Moment Loop (seconds-minutes: act -> see result -> feel progress), the Session Loop (hours-days: engage -> build -> verify -> ship -> reflect), and the Adventure Loop (weeks-months: quest -> discovery -> growth -> new territory). Satisfaction at every timescale. |
| **Discovery Engine** | The Experience Layer subsystem that actively creates conditions for serendipitous insight — through code archaeology, cross-domain pattern recognition, hidden dependency detection, and anomaly surfacing. Discoveries are captured in a personal (and optionally shared) discovery log. |
| **Companion Evolution** | The four-stage growth of an AI companion through shared experience: Interface (learning your style) -> Translator (explaining you to others) -> Navigator (knowing where you should go next) -> Spirit Animal (deep pattern awareness, honest mirror). Measured by how effectively the companion connects you to the world, not by how close it gets to you. |
| **Philosophy Sync** | The mechanism by which high-level philosophy changes propagate traceably to every dependent layer: principle → vision doc → feature spec → domain policy → agent behavior → workflow step. When the philosophy says X, every downstream artifact should reflect X. When X changes to Y, the philosophy sync identifies everything that needs to change. Part of the Coherence Engine's active integration mode. |
| **Personality Layer** | The third layer of the platform stack (Platform -> System of Work -> Personality -> Experience) that gives AI agents consistent, procedurally generated character. Inspired by Borderlands' manufacturer system: constrained variation producing recognizable identity at scale. Structured as a five-layer stack (Function, Tone, Brand, Voice, Moments) where each layer adds to but never contradicts the layers below. |
| **Personality Stack** | The five-layer hierarchy governing all agent personality expression: Layer 1 Function (sacred, immutable accuracy), Layer 2 Tone (platform-wide design pillars), Layer 3 Brand (per-role archetype identity), Layer 4 Voice (per-agent individual character), Layer 5 Moments (memory-tracked rare events). Higher layers are optional; lower layers are always active. |
| **Role Archetype** | One of five base character templates that define agent personality at scale — Navigator (planner), Artisan (implementer), Scout (explorer), Sentinel (reviewer), Custodian (formatter). Each is defined across six dimensions: philosophy, mechanical identity, output convention, flavor vocabulary, voice range, and edge. The scalability mechanism for personality. |
| **Voice Sheet** | A YAML file defining an individual agent's character within archetype constraints — name, vocabulary preferences, quirks, hard constraints (punctuation, word count), relationships with other agents, and evolution history. Layer 4 of the personality stack. What makes "a Sentinel" into "Warden, the Sentinel who tracks null checks like a personal vendetta." |
| **First Principles Propagation** | The system by which core principles are operationalized at every layer — not just documented at the top level but traceable through domain policies, agent behaviors, and workflow steps. Each domain policy traces back to which principles it embodies; each agent can explain *why* it behaves the way it does by referencing the principles. Part of DJ19. |
| **Flavor Pool** | A curated collection of interchangeable personality text fragments for a specific archetype and template slot. Selected by weighted random with novelty tracking to prevent repetition. The most open contribution point in the personality system — anyone can propose new entries. |
| **Design Pillar** (personality layer) | One of six non-negotiable rules governing all agent personality: (1) Function Is Sacred, (2) Character Lives in the Margins, (3) One Sentence Max, (4) Warmth Over Wit, (5) Earned Not Imposed, (6) Pattern Breakage Budget. Ordered by priority — when pillars conflict, lower-numbered pillars win. |
| **Pattern Breakage Budget** | The personality constraint that most outputs are 95% functional / 5% character, with roughly one "moment" per 20 task completions. Memorable events are memorable because they're rare — if every output tried to be memorable, none would be. |
| **Novelty System** | The procedural engine subsystem that prevents personality repetition by tracking recent flavor pool selections per agent, filtering out recently used entries, and weighting remaining entries by inverse recency. Ensures output feels fresh without requiring massive pools. |
| **Moment** (personality layer) | A Layer 5 personality event that emerges from accumulated memory state — a milestone reached, a streak achieved, a callback to a past event. Maximum one per session. Must reference actually-tracked state (never fabricated). The "red flavor text" of the personality system. |
