# Core Philosophy

> **Vision:** A self-learning, human-AI collaborative system that removes mental overhead from life by automating personal and professional task management through intelligent agents, event sourcing, and continuous personalization.

> **Platforms:** React Native (iOS/Android) + Web (React)

Syntropy OS (working name: TaskCard) is built on three pillars:

## Human-AI Collaboration

AI acts as a personal assistant, project manager, and domain-specific agent. Where confidence is high, it acts autonomously. Where confidence is low, it hands off to the human for confirmation or input. The human can always override, correct, and train the system.

## Event Sourcing & Transparency

Every action (human or AI) is event-sourced with a full audit trail. This creates a complete ledger that enables learning, accountability, and trust. Nothing is a black box.

## Continuous Evolution

The system learns from every interaction, refines its models, adapts to user patterns, and evolves over time. It is trainable, correctable, and personalizable.
