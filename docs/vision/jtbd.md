# Jobs to Be Done

The seven core jobs that Syntropy OS exists to fulfill. Every feature must trace back to at least one job.

## J1 — Remove Mental Overhead from Daily Life

**When** I'm overwhelmed by tasks, emails, and commitments scattered across tools, **I want** a single system that captures, organizes, and manages everything **so I can** focus on what actually requires my attention and free up cognitive space.

## J2 — Never Lose Track of Commitments

**When** someone emails me, I have an idea, or a task is mentioned in conversation, **I want** it automatically captured and tracked in a structured system **so that** nothing falls through the cracks regardless of how it originated.

## J3 — Automate Myself Where Possible

**When** there are repetitive, predictable, or low-judgment tasks (unsubscribing, filing, routine replies), **I want** an AI to learn my patterns and handle them autonomously **so that** I only spend time on things that genuinely need my attention.

## J4 — Maintain Control While Delegating to AI

**When** AI acts on my behalf, **I want** full transparency, adjustable confidence thresholds, and the ability to course-correct **so that** I trust the system and remain in control of important decisions.

## J5 — Build a Personal Knowledge & Action System

**When** I accumulate context across emails, notes, tasks, and projects, **I want** a system that connects all of it into a coherent whole **so that** I have a living map of my responsibilities, commitments, and progress.

## J6 — Have Everything About a Life Domain at My Fingertips

**When** I need to reference information about my home, my career, my finances, or any other life domain (measurements, contacts, documents, history), **I want** a single persistent place where it all lives, organized and searchable, **so that** I never have to dig through emails, files, or memory to find what I need.

## J7 — Capture Once, Organize Everywhere

**When** I take a photo, receive a document, or record a voice note, **I want** to just get it into the system and have AI extract the important information, summarize it, and file it in the right places, **so that** I spend zero time on manual data entry, transcription, or filing.
