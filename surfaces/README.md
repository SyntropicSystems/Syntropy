# surfaces

## Purpose

Surface definitions: interfaces through which users (or developers) interact with the system.

## Rules

- Keep repo structure coherent and low-entropy.
- Prefer platform commands over manual restructuring.
- Use YAML frontmatter for docs in this tree.

## Notes

Generated by `syntropy gen readmes`.
