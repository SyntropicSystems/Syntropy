# Surfaces

Syntropy OS is a platform with multiple surfaces — each surface is an interface through which users (or developers) interact with the system. Surfaces share core logic but adapt UX, constraints, and capabilities to their context.

## Product Surfaces

| Surface | Description | File |
|---------|-------------|------|
| Mobile (iOS/Android) | React Native app — swipe, voice, camera, on-the-go | `mobile.md` |
| Web (Desktop) | React web app — keyboard, bulk actions, project review | `web.md` |

## Development Surfaces

| Surface | Description | File |
|---------|-------------|------|
| Dev Platform | This knowledge graph system itself — the methodology for building Syntropy OS | `dev-platform.md` |
| Repo Platform | The engineering infrastructure layer — build, containers, CI/CD, IaC | `repo-platform.md` |
| Workspace Platform | The contract and tooling layer — workspace contracts, validation, scaffolding, plan/apply | `workspace-platform.md` |
