# .devcontainer

## Purpose

Dev/build container configuration.

## Rules

- Keep repo structure coherent and low-entropy.
- Prefer platform commands over manual restructuring.
- Pin toolchain versions to keep builds deterministic.

## Boundaries

- Allowed children:
  - Dockerfile
  - devcontainer.json

## Notes

Generated by `syntropy gen readmes`.
