# apps

## Purpose

Application shells for Syntropy OS and the Dev Platform (thin composition over packages/).

## Rules

- Keep repo structure coherent and low-entropy.
- Prefer platform commands over manual restructuring.
- Keep app shells thin; move shared logic into packages/.
- Apps may depend on packages/; packages must not depend on apps/.
