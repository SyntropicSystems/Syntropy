# functions

## Purpose

Firebase Cloud Functions app shell (placeholder; not yet fully configured).

## Rules

- Keep repo structure coherent and low-entropy.
- Prefer platform commands over manual restructuring.
- Keep app shells thin; move shared logic into packages/.
- Apps may depend on packages/; packages must not depend on apps/.
- No UI dependencies.
- Prefer importing pure domain logic from packages/ over implementing logic in functions.

## Notes

Generated by `syntropy gen readmes`.
