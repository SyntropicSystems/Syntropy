# mobile

## Purpose

Syntropy OS mobile app shell (placeholder; Expo not yet configured).

## Rules

- Keep repo structure coherent and low-entropy.
- Prefer platform commands over manual restructuring.
- Keep app shells thin; move shared logic into packages/.
- Apps may depend on packages/; packages must not depend on apps/.
- Keep this app shell thin; shared logic belongs in packages/.
- Avoid duplicating domain rules; implement them in packages/domain-core first.
