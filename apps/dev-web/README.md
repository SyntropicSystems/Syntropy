# dev-web

## Purpose

Dev Platform web app shell (placeholder; not yet fully configured).

## Rules

- Keep repo structure coherent and low-entropy.
- Prefer platform commands over manual restructuring.
- Keep app shells thin; move shared logic into packages/.
- Apps may depend on packages/; packages must not depend on apps/.
- Keep this app shell thin; shared logic belongs in packages/.
- Prefer evolving the knowledge graph and workspace platform APIs over one-off UI hacks.
