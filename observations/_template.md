# Observation: Short descriptive title

## What happened / What I noticed

(Describe what you observed. Be as detailed or brief as you want. Context helps — what were you doing, what did you expect, what actually happened. But a single sentence is also fine.)

## Why it matters (optional)

(If you know why this matters or what the impact is, share it. If not, skip this.)

## Possible next steps (optional)

(If you have ideas for what to do about this, note them. If not, skip this — someone may pick this up later.)
