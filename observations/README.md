# observations

## Purpose

Raw signals captured over time; see observations/_index.md for workflow and template.

## Rules

- Keep repo structure coherent and low-entropy.
- Prefer platform commands over manual restructuring.
- Capture first; structure later (audit with workflows).

## Notes

Generated by `syntropy gen readmes`.
