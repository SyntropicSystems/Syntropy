# syntropy-sdk

## Purpose

Rust SDK: deterministic workspace discovery, tree/info/readmes/validate.

## Rules

- Keep repo structure coherent and low-entropy.
- Prefer platform commands over manual restructuring.
- Platform never imports from products.
- No binaries in platform crates.
- No printing; return structured types only.
- Prefer deterministic outputs and stable JSON keys.

## Notes

Generated by `syntropy gen readmes`.
